# twitch-stellar-bot

The goal of NovaBot is to expand the number of donation mechanisms so that even the smaller content creators can earn a living on Twitch more easily.

[NovaBot](http://novabot.me) is a chat bot integrated into the Twitch platform's chat. It facilitates the transfer of [Stellar Lumens](https://www.stellar.org/) (XLM), a cryptocurrency, between viewers of live-streams and the broadcaster.

It provides a basic set of chat commands and includes a dashboard to help enable NovaBot on broadcasters' channels to begin accepting XLM donations. Twitch users can deposit and withdraw XLM from the NovaBot dashboard.
